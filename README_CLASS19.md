# Reading Class 19

1- Can you change the state of a data structure using functional programming?

- Functional programming do not change the state of a data structure once it is created. Instead, you create new data structures with modified values, leaving the original data structures intact.

2- Define purely functional programming.

- The emphasis is on expressing a program's logic as the composition of functions and the manipulation of immutable data structures.

3- How do you think purely functional programming will differ from the programs youâ€™ve written so far in this course?

- Functional programming can lead to code that is more concise, maintainable, and testable. However, it may also require learning new concepts and techniques, transitioning to purely functional programming may require a shift in mindset and coding style.

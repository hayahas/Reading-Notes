# Graphs Cheat Sheet 

## Graph Basics:
- Graph: A collection of nodes (vertices) and edges connecting pairs of nodes.

- Directed Graph (Digraph): Edges have a direction (one-way).

- Undirected Graph: Edges have no direction (two-way).

- Weighted Graph: Edges have weights/costs.

- Adjacency Matrix: 2D array representing edges between nodes.

- Adjacency List: Array of lists, each list contains neighbors of a node.

## Graph Terminology:
- Node/Vertex: A fundamental unit of a graph.

- Edge: A connection between two nodes.

- Degree: Number of edges connected to a node.

- Path: Sequence of nodes connected by edges.

- Cycle: Path that starts and ends at the same node.


## Graph Traversal:
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)

## Graph Algorithms:
- Dijkstra's Algorithm
- Bellman-Ford Algorithm
- Prim's Algorithm
- Kruskal's Algorithm
- Topological Sorting

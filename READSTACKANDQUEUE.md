 # Stack And Queues Cheat Sheet

## Stack:
---

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle.
Elements are added and removed from the top of the stack.
Common operations: push (add to the top) and pop (remove from the top).
Used for tasks that require tracking the most recent items, such as undo functionality in text editors.

Stack Operations:

- Push: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
- Pop: Removes and returns the element from the top of the stack.
- Peek/Top: Returns the element from the top without removing it.
- isEmpty: Checks if the stack is empty.
- Size: Returns the number of elements in the stack.

## Queue:
---

A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle.
Elements are added to the back (enqueue) and removed from the front (dequeue) of the queue.
Common operations: enqueue (add to the back) and dequeue (remove from the front).
Used for tasks where order matters, such as processing tasks in order of arrival.

Queue Operations:

- Enqueue: Adds an element to the back of the queue.
- Dequeue: Removes and returns the element from the front of the queue.
- Front/Peek: Returns the element from the front without removing it.
- isEmpty: Checks if the queue is empty.
Size: Returns the number of elements in the queue.

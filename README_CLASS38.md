4- Compare and contrast implicit and explicit intents.

- Explicit Intent: Specifically names the component that should handle the intent.
- Implicit Intent: Does not specify the target component; instead, declares an action to be performed, allowing the system to find the best component to handle it.

5- What is the primary information contained within an Intent?

- An Intent in Android is a messaging object that is used for communication between components, the primary information contained within an Intent includes action, data, type, categories and also extras.

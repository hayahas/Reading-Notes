1- Use an analogy to explain Built-In packages. Give examples.

- Built-in packages in Java can be compared to a well-equipped toolbox that comes with a new house. Just as a toolbox contains essential tools for household tasks, built-in packages in Java come pre-installed with the JDK and offer ready-to-use classes and utilities for developers. Examples of built-in packages include java.lang, java.util, java.io, and java.sql.
